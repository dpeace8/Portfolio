# BE Smart Hackathon 2018 - Check

This repository holds an account of the project (check) that a group of Florida A&M Universities completed during the Black Enterprise BE Smart Hackathon in 2018. Check is a adaptive web app that allows individuals to use Augmented reality to check the size of their bag, pay in-app if it is too large and call an Uber if you are not at the airport.  

##### Senario  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Node.js - Visit https://nodejs.org to download the software.
Development IDE - Our Team utilized Atom IDE to develop and test our code.

Ngrok -
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
1. Clone the repository to your local computer.
2. Use npm install to download any packages needed for development
3. Input the correct credentials to use the necessary APIs.
4. Run the program using :"node start" or and any other related command.
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

There is currently no way to run tests on our code.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
we used
```
