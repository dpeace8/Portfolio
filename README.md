# BE Smart Hackathon 2018

During the Black Enterprise BE Smart Hackathon the Florida A&M University team made a application to solve current problems that American Airlines experienced. Those problem areas included: before traveling to the airport, traveling to the airport, and traveling from one flight to another. Our application gives users the ability to use AR to scan size of travel luggage, pay for luggage inside the app, view directions to the American Airlines Terminal, Request a Uber to the Terminal, converse with a chatbot, and use Facial Recognition to speed up the TSA process. In addition we planned of notifying the user when to leave their current location based on their distance from the airport and when their flight is scheduled to leave.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Node.js - Visit https://nodejs.org to download the software.
Development IDE - Our Team utilized Atom IDE to develop and test our code.
Kairos API keys.
Google Maps Keys
Uber Account
Twilio API Keys.

```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
1. Clone the repository to your local computer.
2. Use npm install to download any packages needed for development
3. Input the correct credentials to use the necessary APIs.
4. Run the program using :"node start" or and any other related command.
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

There is currently no way to run tests on our code.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
